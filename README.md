# Exam Rank 03

>Binaries are **outdated**, compile ``our_[mini|micro]_paint.c`` and use that as a reference.

## Tests

Your code should be in a single file ``micro_paint.c`` (or ``mini_paint.c``).  
You can start ``test.sh`` and it will generate random good or bad examples that will be tested by ``our_micro_paint`` and **your** program.  
The result of both programs (exit code) are tested and the output is tested with diff.  
A **0** indicates it tested a non-valid file and **1** a valid file.

The tests end when an error occur, and you can see the example that caused the error in ``example_``, and the good output in ``coutput`` and your output in ``output``.
