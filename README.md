# Exam Rank 03

## Tests

Your code should be in a single file ``micro_paint.c``.  
You can start ``test.sh`` and it will generate random good or bad examples that will be tested by ``our_micro_paint`` and **your** program.  
The result of both programs (exit code) are tested and the output is tested with diff.

The tests end when an error occur, and you can see the example that caused the error in ``example_``, and both output in ``coutput`` and ``output``.
